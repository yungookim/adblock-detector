# Micro javascript library for checking the presence of Adblock

Usage  
  
```javascript
// After everything is loaded

var ADBD = new ADBD(function(adblockInstalled){
  if(adblockInstalled){
    // Adblock present
  } else {
    // Adblock not present
  }
});

// There will be a case where Adblock will block the current script
if(typeof ADBD === 'undefined' || !ADBD) {
    // Adblock present
}

```
